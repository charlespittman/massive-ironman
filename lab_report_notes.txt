The lab reports are written with the LaTeX markup language, which can
be frustrating to learn, but provides several advantages:

1. The input file(s) are plain-text, so can be edited on essentially
any computer.

2. It handles the layout automatically, including section/table/figure
numbers and references, which is especially helpful when adding/moving
these in a document.  It can even generate a table of contents for
each.

3. Equations are very easy to write.

4. The final document just looks plain amazing, with much less work
than goes into a typical Word document of similar complexity.

It can look intimidating at first, but it is mostly straightforward.
It's _highly_ recommended to use an editor with syntax highlighting.

While I haven't had a chance to try it, everyone I know that edits
LaTeX on Windows uses MiKTEX (http://miktex.org).  There's even a
portable edition that can be run from a flash drive.  It should be as
simple as loading the .tex file and compiling.

I set up a repository on GitHub to do version control
(https://github.com/charlespittman/massive-ironman).  Check out
(http://windows.github.com/) for a Windows client, as well.  Just
fork the repository, make whatever changes, and do a pull request.

There's a semi-updated, commented template in the school/elec_311/tex
directory.  I'll try to make a more general template some time this
week.
