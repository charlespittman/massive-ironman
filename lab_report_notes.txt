The report's written with the LaTeX markup language, which can be frustrating
to learn, but provides several advantages:
1. The input file(s) are plain-text, so can be edited on essentially any
computer.
2. It handles the layout automatically, including section/table/figure numbers
and references, which is especially helpful when adding/moving these in a
document.  It can even generate a table of contents for each.
3. Equations are very easy to write.
4. The final document just looks plain amazing, with much less work than goes
into a typical Word document of similar complexity.

It can look intimidating at first, but it is mostly straightforward.

While I haven't had a chance to try it, everyone I know that edits LaTeX in
Windows uses MiKTEX (http://miktex.org).  There's even a portable edition that
can be run from a flash drive.  It should be as simple as loading the .tex file
and compiling.

I set up a repository on GitHub to do version control
(https://github.com/charlespittman/massive-ironman).  Check out
(http://windows.github.com/) for a Windows client, as well.  Just clone the
repository, make whatever changes and sync.

The files for lab 1 are in the school/elec_302/lab_01 directory, and
lab_report_1.tex and test_circuit.png are the two files you're looking for.
