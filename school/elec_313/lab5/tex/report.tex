\section{Procedure}
\label{sec:procedure}

\subsection{CMOS Inverter}
\label{sec:inverter}

% First, the ($+$) and ($-$) terminals of the motor driver board were connected to the \SI{6}{V} DC power supply.  Wires were connected to the motor output terminals on the left side of the motor driver board.  Inputs $L_1$, $L_2$, and $E1-2$ (Enable) were connected in accordance with Table~\ref{tab:logic}.  The output of the DC power supply was set to \SI{6}{V} and the motor output voltage ($V_{out}$) was measured and the LED's were observed, with values recorded in Table~\ref{tab:logic}.  Then, the output of the DC power supply was turned off and \SI{6}{V} DC motor was connected to the output of the motor driver board.  The output of the DC power supply was set to \SI{6}{V} and inputs were connected in accordance with Table~\ref{tab:logic} and the direction of motor rotation was also recorded in Table~\ref{tab:logic}.  Finally, $L_1$, $L_2$, and $Enable$ were set in the clockwise motor rotation and the DC power supply was swept from \SI{6}{V} to \SI{3}{V} in \SI{0.1}{V} increments and the effect on the motor's speed.

\subsection{CMOS NAND}
\label{sec:nand}

% First the function generator was set to a square wave with a frequency of 20 kHz.  Channel 1 of the oscilloscope was connected to the output of the function generator and the square wave was offset for \SI{0}{V} to \SI{5}{V}.  $L_1$ and $L_2$ were again set for clockwise rotation and the $Enable$ input was connected to the function generator.  The DC power supply was turned on and set to \SI{6}{V}.  Then, the \%Duty of the square wave was swept from 20\% to 80\% in 10\% increments and the motor driver board output was recorded in Table~\ref{tab:duty}.  After that, the output of the DC power supply was turned off and the \%Duty of the function generator was rest to 50\%.  Then, the \SI{6}{V} DC motor was connected to the motor output of the motor driver board and the output of the DC power supply was set to \SI{6}{V}.  The \%Duty of the square wave was swept from 50--80\% in 1\% increments and motor speed was observed.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

% The motor driver board can be adjusted to control the speed and direction of the DC motor.  First, the $Enable$ input must ``see'' ~\SI{5}{V} before the motor driver board can then allow the $L_1$ and $L_2$ inputs control the phase/rotation of the output.  To control the output rotation, the $L_1$ and $L_2$ inputs must also see ~\SI{5}{V} separately.  In our configuration, $L_1$ caused the motor to rotate counter-clockwise.  Similarly, $L_2$ caused clockwise rotation, so enabling both causes the motor to stop.

% The motor driver board speed was adjusted via two different approaches in the experiment: in part one, the input voltage was adjusted, changing the output voltage;  in part two, the frequency of the input signal was adjusted, which also affected output voltage.
