\section{Procedure}
\label{sec:procedure}

\subsection{DC Characteristics}
\label{sec:inverter}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct the circuit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}. Use the HP multimeter to measure the drain current, $I_D$ , and the Fluke multimeters to measure $V_{DS}$ and $V_{GS}$. Use the +\SI{6}{V} power supply for $V_{GG}$ and the +\SI{25}{V} supply for $V_{DD}$.
\item Set $V_{GG}$ to 0 V and $V_{DD}$ to \SI{5}{V} and measure $V_{DS}$ and $I_D$.
\item Slowly increase $V_{GG}$ until the transistor just begins to conduct current as evidenced by a small drop in $V_{DS}$. Record the value of $V_{GS}$ as the Gate Threshold Voltage, $V_{TN}$.
\item Adjust $V_{GG}$ to increase $V_{GS}$ by \SI{0.2}{V} above the threshold. Readjust $V_{DD}$ to return $V_{DS}$ to \SI{5}{V}, and then measure the drain current ($I_D$ ). Record the value of $V_{GS}$ in the first column of table1, and record the value of $I_D$ in the second column (the $V_{DS}$ = \SI{5}{V} column).
\item Continue increasing $V_{GS}$ in \SI{0.2}{V} steps while maintaining $V_{DS}$ at \SI{5}{V}, measuring the drain current at each step. Record the values of $V_{GS}$ and $I_D$ in table 1. Stop this process when the drain current reaches approximately 80mA.
\item Complete the entries in table 1 by adjusting $V_{DD}$ and $V_{GG}$ to obtain the various required $V_{DS}$ and $V_{GS}$ values, then measuring $I_D$ at each value. Do not exceed 80mA drain current.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Small-Signal Transconductance}
\label{sec:nand}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Adjust $V_{GG}$ and $V_{DD}$ to obtain $V_{DS}$ = \SI{5}{V} and $I_D$ = \SI{10}{mA}.
\item Record the value of $V_{GS}$ as $V_{G1}$.
\item Record the exact measured value of $I_D$ and assign it to $I_{D1}$. Use the full resolution of the HP multimeter.
\item Increase $V_{GS}$ by \SI{10}{mV} and record it value as $V_{G2}$.
\item Measure $I_D$ , recording it as $I_{D2}$.
\item Compute the small signal transconductance (Eq~\ref{eq:transconduct}).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The following table shows several $V_{GS}$ values that are just slightly over the overdrive voltage $V_{OV}$ and gives an idea of the amount of variation for values resulting from Equation~\ref{eq:phys}.

    \hline
    $V_{GS}$ = \SI{2.91}{V} & & & 0.1078 \\
    $V_{GS}$ = \SI{2.71}{V} & & 0.0931 & \\
    $V_{GS}$ = \SI{2.51}{V} & 0.07688 & & \\

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

It’s hard to compare the Figure~\ref{fig:graph} plot with the 2N7000 data sheet because the data sheet’s lowest $V_{GS}$ curve is 3 V, which is still higher than the highest $V_{GS}$ curve in Figure~\ref{fig:graph}. However, it is still apparent that the $V_{GS}$ curve of \SI{2.91}{V} in Figure~\ref{fig:graph} is similar to the \SI{3}{V} curve because the $V_{OV}$ points are roughly the same with a $V_{DS}$ value of 1 – 1.5 V. After the $V_{OV}$ point, both curves taper off and have a very slight positive slope.

It’s easier to compare Figure~\ref{fig:graph} plot with the PSpice simulation because the $V_{GS}$ are closer to the values seen in Figure~\ref{fig:graph}. Again the $V_{OV}$ values are similar in both the plot and the simulation. But, the PSpice simulation curves are “flat” at points beyond the $V_{OV}$ instead of sloped like it is in Figure~\ref{fig:graph}.

The second PSpice simulation was more representative of the Figure~\ref{fig:graph} plots because the value of $\lambda$ was changed from 0 to 0.06, which made the $V_{GS}$ curves slope beyond the $V_{OV}$. Adding the $\lambda$ also “raised” the $I_D$ current for the individual $V_{OV}$ points. This is because the $\lambda$ value represents the slight resistance that is inherent to the transistor – a low $\lambda$ value is a higher resistance and a high $\lambda$ is a lower resistance because the resistance is the inverse of the $\lambda$.
