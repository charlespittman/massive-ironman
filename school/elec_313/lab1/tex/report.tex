The objective is to verify the equivalence of four circuits used to
model an amplifier, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:amp_models}.

\section{Procedure}
\label{sec:procedure}

First, the resistors that were intended for use in the experiment were
measured with a multimeter and recorded in Table 1.  Then the circuit
in Figure 1 was built on a breadboard.  A function generator was
programmed to output a sine wave at $1\si{\kilo\hertz}$.  The test
configuration was constructed as shown in Figure 2 using Fluke
multimeters as the ammeters and an oscilloscope as both voltmeters.
The function generator was added to the circuit as the voltage input
($V_i$) and, with the oscilloscope measuring the voltage generator,
the amplitude was adjusted to $200\si{\volt_{rms}}$.  The input
voltage, input current, and output voltage were taken and recorded in
Table 2 with the open circuit across the load terminals.  Finally, the
decade box was added to the output terminals (V0 in Figure 1) of the
circuit and, set to $200 \si{\ohm}$, and the output voltage was
measured and recorded in (Table 2).

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

As seen in Table 3, the measured results of the circuit were very
close to the calculated values using nominal values of the resistors.
This shows that the four amplifier models shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:amp_models} are closely representative of the
operational amplifier circuit seen in Figure 1.  The highest \%
difference when comparing the measured with the nominal theoretical
value was only 4.8\% (current gain [Ai] Table 3)!

\section*{Equations}

% LaTeX sees blank lines as a start of another paragraph.  To avoid
% unnecessary vertical spaces between equations, and still visually
% separate in source, put a comment between them.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:percent_error}
  \%_{error} = \frac{|measured - nominal|}{nominal} \times 100\%
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:R_o}
  R_o = \frac{V_{noload} - V_{load}}{I_{load}}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:R_i}
  R_i = \frac{V_i}{I_i}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:A_v}
  A_v = \frac{V_o}{V_i}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:A_i}
  A_i = A_v \left(\frac{R_i}{R_o}\right)
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:G_m}
  G_m = \frac{A_v}{R_o}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:R_m}
  R_m = A_v R_i
