  \section{Introduction}
  The study of electronics generally begins with exloring the function and
  operation of \ac{DC} circuits, with skills learned then translated for
  \ac{AC} circuits.  In that translation some students tend to focus more on
  applying the formulas in problem solving, losing sight of how they were
  derived.  As a result, they may have trouble explaining how \ac{AC} is
  generated, how it functions, and  why sinusoidal functions are used in the
  equations.

  \section{What is \ac{AC}?}
  Because current flows in a single direction in \ac{DC} circuits, the polarity
  of any terminal stays constant.  As the name implies, direction of current
  flow in \ac{AC} circuits alternates, and polarity at terminals with it.
  Figure~\ref{acwave} shows how these values change over time.  One full
  alternation, or period, is marked by the section $T$; the frequency of an
  \ac{AC} value refers to the number of periods per second.

  The horizontal axis in Figure~\ref{acwave} can be measured in time, degrees,
  or radians.  One cycle of a sinusoidal wave is 360$^\circ$ or 2$\pi$ radians.
  This figure also illustrates phase angle, either as the time delay between
  two waveforms or as the angle between them.  This time difference is also
  what is being referred to when a waveform is described as either ``leading''
  or ``lagging'' another.  With respect to a reference, a leading waveform is
  one that is further along in its cycle.

  \section{How is it Generated?}
  Figure~\ref{alternator} shows a simple model of a three-phase alternator,
  consisting of a magnetic rotar and stator with three separate sets of coil
  windings mounted 120$^\circ$ from each other.  In accordance with Faraday's
  law of induction, the relative movement of the magnetic field to the
  conductors as the shaft rotates an \ac{EMF} is created.
