Answer the following from data within the 2013 edition of the "International
Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors".

1. From the Executive Summary:
  a. How many key contributors were in the “metrology” working group?  How
     about in the “test and test equipment” group?

     There are 26 in the "Metrology" group. There are 77 in the "Test and Test
     Equipment".

  b. Just by glance, which group has the most key contributors?  The "Emerging
     Research Materials" has the most key contributors.

  c. Roughly, how many people contributed to the road map in total?  From the
     entire document?  There are about 1,100 key contributors.

2. Click around the road map, be awed by its depth and staggered by its detail. Then find some obscure but interesting fact to share with the class in a couple of paragraphs (no more than one page) of writing.

   The testing section is titled "Test and Test Equippment".  Not important,
   but a glaring oversight. [1]

   Chemistry is _way_ more important than I thought.  "Emerging Research
   Materials" having so many contributors should have been a hint.  A large
   chunk of the research and difficulties revolves around finding new materials
   with desired properties.  The two most common properties are less-lossy
   dialetrics and smaller footprints with comparable mechanical properties.
